        At a certain point of my study, I had to play "freedom jazz dance" for an exam. It was a tough challenge for me because, in a way, it sounds really modern to me, but it is constructed on just one only chord.<br>
        Just one chord, no changes. What to do to sound modern ? At this time, I was almost confrontated to scores with challenging changes and had no clues of what to do. <br>
        I observed the theme and his construction, and understood how important were the fourth. <br>
        Since that time, fourth have a special feeling for me, and I propose you here a selection of melodic ideas from jazzmen using this interval.<br>
