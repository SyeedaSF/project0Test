          Hello, <br>
          My name is Pierre Martinet, I'm a french flutist from Paris<br>
          I studied classical music in conservatory and now, I follow my way, learning jazz and practicing traditional music too.<br>
          Transmission is important for me, that's why my job is to teach flute and music conservatory in school.<br>
          I want to make my own website to share pedagogic material and things I practice with my instrument.

            Why learning web programming ? <br>
            I started to make a basic personnal blog with wordpress, but I feel a lot of frustration about dont being able to understand all I can do with it.<br>
            I follow this course because I want to learn how to get free to do all I want to create and manage my website.<br>
            I also have the project to create some little applications integrated in my website to help my student to practice ear training.
