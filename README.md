# Project 0

Hello
My name is Pierre Martinet, I'm a french flutist and teacher, and I want to make my own website to share pedagogic stuff and things I practice with my instrument.
I started to make a basic personnal blog with wordpress, but I feel a lot of frustration about dont being able to understand all I can do with it.
I follow this course because I want to learn how to get free to do all I want to create and manage my website.
I have the project to create some little applications integrated in my website to help my student to practice ear training.

For project0, I gonna make a try about doing a little preview of what could have been my blog.
Here are the contents I plan to create :
- a welcoming page with "news" article, and a pressentation of the differents parts
- a file with ear exercise, with link to the songs
- A list of exercises on the fourth for jazz pracice
- an analyse of a solo, with image of the solo and possibility to download the file
- an About page : Some precisions about myself

Requirements of the project0 validation and where to find them :

    Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
    Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
    You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.
    Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
    In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
