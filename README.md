# Project 0

Hello
My name is Pierre Martinet, I'm a french flutist and teacher, and I want to make my own website to share pedagogic stuff and things I practice with my instrument.
I started to make a basic personnal blog with wordpress, but I feel a lot of frustration about dont being able to understand all I can do with it.
I follow this course because I want to learn how to get free to do all I want to create and manage my website.
I have the project to create some little applications integrated in my website to help my student to practice ear training.

For project0, I gonna make a try about doing a little preview of what could have been my blog.
Here are the contents I plan to create :
- a welcoming page with "news" article, and a presentation of the different parts
- a file with ear exercise, with link to the songs
- A list of exercises on the fourth for jazz practice
- an analyse of a solo, with image of the solo and possibility to download the file
- an About page : Some precisions about myself
